Using the Trend Micro Deepsecurity REST API

This repo collects python and powershell scripts I use to report on the configuration of a Trend Micro DeepSecurity as a service installation.

To use it you need to have access to an API secret key and know the Deep Security Manager URL. Both need ot be stored in a [properties.json]() file in the base directory of the repo. The file is included in [.gitignore](.gitignore) so won't end in the public repo.
